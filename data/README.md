## Dataset

The example uses the Kaggle dataset [The Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) created by Rounak Banik. You can download it from there as a ZIP file. Once expanded you should see the following files in your data directory.

* `credits.csv`
* `links.csv`
* `ratings_small.csv`
* `ratings.csv`
* `movies_metadata.csv`
* `keywords.csv`

Of these, we only need the `movies_metadata.csv` and `keywords.csv` files.
